# Magma OS
Magma OS is a  simple OS based on Debian. Magma features stock Debian features, plus aliases and software to make Linux
an easy learning experience. For example, in Magma, you can simply do `install package`.
Althogh magma is not made for new linux users unlike ubuntu and mint, but if you find debian hard to use and install, but want all of the freedom debian offers, magma will be a great choice!!
